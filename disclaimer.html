Know Your Ropes was created to promote top rope anchor mindfulness and safety checks, this application does not substitute for hands on anchor building instruction, and should not be used as a guide for building top rope anchors. Each top rope anchor composition, equipment, and environmental conditions are unique and cannot be replicated in a conceptual diagram of any form. Know Your Ropes is not liable for any anchor failures, equipment misuse, or any other climbing mishaps. Climbing is an inherently dangerous sport! Build anchor systems only at your own risk, always triple check your top rope systems, and when in doubt sit it out!
